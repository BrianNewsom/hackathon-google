# Objective 2. Data App

## Mockup 

Our idea is a notification app that notifies you when changes are made to a file in drive. This tool would be best utilized as a chrome extension or google now.
Key features:
* Links to Hangouts and the drive document

Stretch goals:
* Create an application that is integrated more closely with other word processing programs (VIM)
* Machine learning to discern the idea behind the change

## Use cases 


## API uses 

(specific Google APIs you will need to use to make the app)

## Implementation plan 

(how your team would build this app if given sufficient time)
